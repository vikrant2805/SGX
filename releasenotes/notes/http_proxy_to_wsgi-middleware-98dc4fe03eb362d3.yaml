    This release adds http_proxy_to_wsgi middleware to the pipeline.
features:
  - The 'http_proxy_to_wsgi' middleware can be used to help barbican
    respond with the correct URL refs when it's put behind a TLS
    proxy (such as HAProxy). This middleware is disabled by default,
    but can be enabled via a configuration option in the oslo_middleware
    group.
upgrade:
  - The barbican-api-paste.ini configuration file for the paste pipeline
    was updated to add the http_proxy_to_wsgi middleware.
